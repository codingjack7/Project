<p>Hello my name is Henry I am a <i>Daddy longlegs spider </i> that lives in this old house There are other spiders that live here with me. 
I end up spending the most time with this one spider named jack he is a <i>HOBO 
spider</i>. Jack does not like me much we never see eyes to eyes I mostly just stay to myself whenever he comes too my side of the house 
we fight over food. One day in the middle of summer jack and me we are fighting over some food 
when some tall monsters walked in like they owned the place I looked at jack and said what is going on what are they?
 Jack just said the food is mine I looked at jack and said this is not the time for this let find out what going on and why these monsters are doing here. He cares about the 
food over the monsters I said fine take it I am going to keep my eyes on them they went from area to area after a while they 
stopped and look that this strange thing in their hands. I tried to get a closer look at it when I got closer to the strange thing they 
spotted me they tried to kill me. Somehow I got away from there a live and one piece I watched they leave the strange thing on the wood table and left my place finally. I started looking for jack it took a few 
hours hiding in his favor it spot a few area from where I live at and he comes to take my food time to time I wanted to talk with him about the strange monsters that 
just left. Jacked looked at me and said why you are here? You said I could have the food. that not why I am here jack I wanted to talk about the monsters that just left
 they left something her and I will need your help if they come back I was almost killed last time I tried to see what was going on. I will give you some of my food if you will help me out. Jack just looked at 
me for a few minutes thinking about it. Jack said fine I will help you out this time for half of your foods I looked at him and
 said ugh fine just this one time. I showed him the way we starting climbing the wood table by the time we got to the top we were so tired that we slept the rest of the day way there.
 The next day I woke jack up we just looked at the paper thing in front of us 
The next day I woke jack up we just looked at the paper thing in front of us we looked at it while looking at it we saw an opening I put one of my legs in the whole think some would happen but nothing happened to me I decide to put more of my body in the hole. Looking around I could see something is on it but
 was not sure I try putting my legs on the paper thing it started to move jack started to freak out and stated to yell Henry are you OK? I said yes I am fine it just me trying something but no luck in here. I got out of the paper thing I walked over to jack and said you think we can move this 
 thing to see what is in side it? He just said maybe we will have to try and go from there after trying a few times it would just go back to normal. Jack said let’s stop for now and think what we can do to keep this paper thing open
 I said fine let’s meet back in three days after thinking about this. Two days later I started to clime my way back up this time it was a lot easier because we left some webs behind go get up there with ease when I got there I saw 
 jack just sleeping I started to look at it once more trying to fighter something out. A little while later jack woke up and said hello Henry what are you doing? I said I am still trying to
 think a way to move this paper thing. He just smiled at me and said it ok I started working on that here the plane we will put webs on the end of this paper like you can see over there on 
 the right piece. I went over and look at it I just said hmmm ok I like this idea I started to add a little webbing to the right then moved to the left side of the paper helping jack web it down after a 
 few hours we tried to move the paper. We had a hard time moving it by our self it took a very long time and we had to web down the sides it took us one full day. After a long rest we looked at what is on the paper
 they plan on tearing down our house and replace it with a flower shop I looked at jack said what should we do it looks like they will be back in a month. Jack said not sure we might have to find some other place 
 to live there nothing we can do to stop them
 we are very little compared to them last time you tried you were also most killed on the spot. I just looked at him and said here is the plan
<details><summary>Good Ending</summary>
We should let everyone else know what going to happen and plan accordingly we do not want anyone left behind or lost if they want to stay after know this info that for them to decide. After I info some spiders I plan
 on going outside and start looking for a new place to live. We will need to get some help finding new places to live. We are going have to split up in 
too four groups sadly. After telling a few spider words spread throughout the house fast before I knew it about ¾ of the spiders were in the front of the house asking what going?  Jack and I informed 
them on what going we need to send out a few outside some will not make it back from the trip sadly there not much we can do if we stay here we will die. 
I and a twenty other spiders went out and look for a place to live from now on we were going for a few days we lost seven friends on 
the trip sadly but they did not die in vain we found a great place but it very small a small group came with me to our new home I did not see jack before
 I left. I waited ten days for his group returns sadly he never came back when my group left I hope he is safe. A few days later we 
got to our new place with a few deaths on the way here but everyone is now happy with the new place I never heard from jack.

Let’s info everyone then let’s start plan a way to stop them from taking over our place. A few minutes later most of the spiders showed up I asked what you think the best attack plan to 
take them down. Jack said let’s leave let them have this place there are plenty of other places out there to live at. 
I said no this is our place why should we give it to them? The group was divided on what to do most of the spiders went with jack. I started to plan on how 
to stop them with whoever would join me. A few days of webbing our place to keep them out but to no success they just teardown
 the place before we knew what happen a lot of us we dead I was badly injured I was hanging on a thread I saw a small group of spiders run 
for their lives. I could not get away I was crushed under the house rubble I hope the small group that got away safely.
