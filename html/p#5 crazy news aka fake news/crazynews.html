<span style="color:red"><font size="9">J</font></span>ill cial was walking in the Arizona Chiricahua Park Monday on November 15 2178 going for a walk for a little break from her everyday life.
 About 26 minutes in to the walk she felt like someone was watching her. She looked around and found nothing was there she decide to just keep going for a few minutes longer When the feeling 
 would come back she decided to head back to her car when she saw a very tall monster hiding in the trees just staring at her after standing there scared out of her mind for like 7 seconds she ran 
 as fast as she could. When she got back to her car she called the police a few minutes later the police showed up and talked to her for a few minutes.The police asked what the monster 
looked like the only thing she could tell them was it was close to 7'4 feet tall fur or a lot of hair also asked if she had taken any kind of drugs today or been drinking today? she said no to the 
police. they looked at her and asked where she first saw it and when she felt she was being watched from. they looked around found nothing to support her claims until they got to the place where she
 saw the monster when they got there they only found was some odd looking fur. Let us know what you think happen down below in the comments and have a great day thanks for reading crazy news.

 <h2>Jack geids February 4 2051 he found some very old bones in his backyard after he started digging a hole for a swimming pool. A few days in to the dig he found some bone that looked a little odd 
 he took them to get examined it turns out to be 1204 years old bone from a cat. After a little more digging he found a lot more bones a lot of Archaeologists wanted to dig up a lot of the land around 
 him but only ending up with just the backyard of jack for now in time they hope to start digging in the neighbor backyards. After about 2 month's of carefully digging they found some very old graveyard
 with some dog and cat bones from a very small tribe that lived there. They are trying to figure out what kind of tribe they were and if there any other native Indians tribes from around there area. 
 Nothing else is known at this time we will keep you updated so please stay tuned for any new info.
