	My name is Linnea I am not looking forward to this trip my mom planned for us last minute. I just want to do is stay home and text my friends. I hate my parents for making me go on this stupid trip to some campground I will not be able 
	to text my friends and I might be get dirty or brake a nail out there plus there nothing to do out there I hate my life right now I wish I had the option to stay home like my brother. If he comes along I am going to be 
	stuck with the two dogs in the back and the get very excited when they come along in a car ride and get fur everywhere plus I want to just hang with my friends for a few days before we go back to 
	school in two weeks. At the last minute my brother decides he going to come a long for the family trip what a drag now. I am going to have a very hard time 
	texting my girlfriends this sucks I better make a diary on my phone for now then tell them all about it when I get back. My sister has a camera to take pictures of the wild life.
	We left about an hour ago So far I hate it a lot because of the dogs going crazy and having trouble texting on my phone misspelling a lot because the dogs keep running back and forth to bark at the cows that we are passing.
	I gave up texting to my friends for now and plus not a great signal out here I am hating my life right now my dad and his shity music is driving me crazy I am just going to take a nap for now.</div>	
	<div class="crazy">We finally got there I was sleeping in the back for a while they set up camp after I got up I got mad and sad why did you not wake me up? I could have helped they just looked at me. My mom said you look so a peaceful we did not want to
	wake you up from your sleep. My dad said that my sister joy and I are going to share a tent I looked at him and said why dose 
	Luigi get a tent all to himself why can I sleep with mom?  Dad responded because mom and I want some time to ourselves to talk and do some other stuff. The next
	day when I woke up my sister, dad and one of the dogs are gone I asked mom where they went? She 
	looked at me and said they went fishing for dinner and they should be back later to night. she asked if I would like to go on a walk with her and my brother I look at her said I really
	don’t  want to but I don’t want to be here all alone by myself.  Later that night my sister and dad came back from fishing with a few fish for dinner I asked did you guys have fun out there? My sister said it was a lot
	of fun I wish I joined them. Later that night I was to adding a lot to my diary my sister looked at me and just smiled I looked at her and said what are you looking at? She just smiled at me
	then went to sleep.  The next day it was starting to snowing my dad and mom looked at us and said let's go home we do not have the supplies for snow and its odd not supposed to snow for a
	least another 2 weeks. so we got everything loaded up in the car I was very unhappy that I got stuck in the back with the dog once more but this time my phone is dead. I have nothing else
	to do I look at my sister sleeping on the way home I was thinking about sleeping as well but I just ended up looking out the window for the rest of the trip home and tried to keep the dogs calm.</div>
