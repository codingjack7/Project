<p class="tetsize"><strong>	The next morning I just went on a walk by myself this time but I did take one of the dogs it was a lot of fun. I could see some wildlife when I got back to camp I looked around and most people did not want to do anything until tomorrow. I just went back in my tent and list to the radio for most of the day or I went on a walk. 	Hello my name is Olen and I am happily married to Ashlea my wife we have three kids. My wife works at the high school as a math teacher. This year my wife been bugging me nonstop to go camping over see my family since her family passed away two years ago she was an only child she does not like to talk about them. I said fine we will go camping this time over seeing my family. With a big smile on her face she ran off to talk with the kids and see if they will come along. My two daughters will be coming along but my son is not sure I just wish he would stay here I really dislike his life choice he likes to think he dead to me but I still love him. I started to loading the car with most of the stuff we will need for the camping trip I just hope it does not snow it shouldn't happen for at least for two weeks. They are taking so long to get everything in the car that I am just getting more and more mad that they are taking so long. 
I like to have everything so smoothly I want things done on time I hate things taking so long to get done. We finally leave one hour later. I turn on some music I love but my kids hate but they are not driving so too bad we spend about three hours in traffic when we finally get to our spot my youngest kid is sound asleep. we let the two dogs out I will keep a close eye on them while making camp after we get done my youngest wakes up and starts getting yelling. I was getting pretty mad when she started yelling at everyone. 
The next morning Joy and I decide to go fishing for dinner and we will take one of the dogs with us on the way out there we saw so many birds and deer running around. I just wanted to go fishing after a few hours we caught a few fish. We started heading back to the camp on the way back we see a wild Bobcat the dog wanted to go after it but I grabbed it by the collar we waited a few minute to see if it would go away on its own before we started going back to camp. The dog calmed down when the Bobcat finally left we started to walk back to camp on the way back we just talked. We finally got back to camp with the fish joy and I start cleaning descaling them before we cook them.
The next morning I just looked for water to take a bath and relax for a few hours nothing much going on today everyone wants to do their own thing which is fine since I want to see my family like usual. I get back to camp later that night I enjoys telling campfire storyâ€™s before bed. We woke around five twenty-seven in the morning because it was so cold I look outside I see so much snow  I wake everyone up and said we are heading home get everything in the car now before it gets much worst.
