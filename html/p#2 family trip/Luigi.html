<p class="red">Hello my name is Luigi right now I work at crazy town pizza it a new place that just opened up about 3 months ago. Right now I am planning on moving to San Francisco with
 my boyfriend who I been dating for three years now. his name is Elden my parents were not happy when I told them but my mom is fine 
with it but I am pretty much dead to my dad I try very hard to make him happy and accept me for who I am but sadly nothing has changed. My mom is planning a camping trip I am not sure
 if I will go I need to talk with my boyfriend first before I do anything. After a good long talk with my boyfriend and my mom I decide to go on the trip 
after I told my sisters. Linnea was mad at me because now she stuck in the back with the dogs 
and they love to freak out whenever they see a dog or some things close to one also cats they love going after them.</p>

<p class="orange">We finally got everything in the car we are about to head out when I forgot my phone in my room I asked if I could go get it but my dad was super 
mad already because we are running a little late. He told me NO you can
 live without your phone for a week. I just said OK letâ€™s go then I just end up sleeping all the way there when I woke up we reached the front entice to the camping ground after looking for a few minutes we found a spot.
 We all got out of the car and start unpacking I asked what the plans who sleeping with who. My dad looked at me and said you will get your own tent. Your sisters will share a tent mom and me. 
After getting everything set up my little sister woke up and started to get mad. A short 
while later I got in my tent started listening to music on the radio I took with me. A few minutes later I fell asleep listing to the radio. </p>

<p class="yellow">The next morning I woke up to my mom making food for breakfast and it smelled great everyone else started waking up but my little sister. My sister joy and dad
 went fishing with one of the dogs after breakfast. Two hours later my sister woke up and asked were the others went? My mom told
 her they went fishing. Then asked would any one like to go on a walk? I wanted to it sounded a lot of fun I asked are we going to take the other dog with us?
 My mom looked at me and said yes then she asked my sister and she said yes but was not very happy about it from the look on her face.
 We left for the walk after locking up everything making sure all the food in the car. We should be back before the others come back. </P>

 <p class="ggreen">The next morning I just went on a walk by myself this time but I did take one of the dogs it was a lot of fun. I could see some wildlife when I got back to camp I looked around and most
 people did not want to do anything until tomorrow. I just went back
 in my tent and list to the radio for most of the day or I went on a walk.</p>

<p class="blue">The next morning it stated to snowing which was a surprise for everyone
 it should have not snowed for one to two weeks from now
. we packed everything back into the car started head home. 
I just looked out the window the hole time while me and my dad we are only ones to stay awake the hole way home we did not say much 
to each other but I love the trip I wish it did not snow.</p>
