	My name is Linnea I am not look forward to this trip my mom planed for us last minute all I want to do is stay home and text my friends. I hate my parents for making me go on this stupid trip to some campground I will not be able to text all my friends and I might be get dirty or brake a nail out there plus there nothing to do out there I hate my life right now I wish I had the option to stay home like my brother lucky him. If he comes along I am going to be stuck with the two dogs in the back and the get very excited when they come along in a car ride and get fur everywhere plus I want to just hang with my friends for a few days before we go back to school in two weeks. At the last min my brother decides he going to come a long for the family trip what a drag now I going to have a very hard time text my GFs this sucks I better make a diary on my phone for now then tell them all about it my sister has a camera to take pic of the wild life.

	We leave for the family trip so far hating it a lot because of the dogs going crazy and having trouble text on my phone misspelling a lot because the dogs keep running back and forth to bark at the cows that we are passing. I gave up texting to my friends for now and plus not a great signal out here I am hating my life right now my dad and his shifty music is driving me crazy I am just going to take a nap for now.
	
	We finally got there my family let me just sleep while they set up camp after I got up I got mad and sad why did you not wake me up? I could have helped my mom looked at me and just sad you look so a peace we did not want to wake you up from your sleep.  My dad sad that my sister joy are going to share a tent I looked at him and sad why dose Lulgi get a tent all to himself why can I sleep with mom? Dad response: Because mom and I want some time to our self to talk and do some other stuff.
	
	The next day I sleep in when I woke up my sister, dad and one of the dogs are gone so I asked mom where they went? She looked at me and said they went fishing for dinner and they should be back later to night then she asked if she would like to go on a walk with her and my brother I look at her said I really don’t  want to but I don’t want to her all alone by myself.  Later that night my sister and dad came back from fishing with a few fish for dinner I asked did you guys have fun out there? My sister sad it was a lot of fun I wish I joined them I said in my head. Later that night I was to adding a lot to my diary my sister looked at me and just smiled I looked at her and said what are you looking at? Just smiled at me then went to sleep. 
	
	The next day it was starting to snowing my dad and mom looked at us and said let go home we do not have the supplies for snow and it odd not supposed to snow for a least  another 2 weeks  so we got everything loaded up in the car I was very unhappy that I got stuck in the back with the dog once more but this time my phone is dead and I have nothing else to do I look at my sister sleeping on the way home I was thinking about it but I just ended up looking out the window for the rest of the trip home and tried to keep the dog calm.
