<p>I live at home with my parents going to college learning to become a Veterinarian. One day I would like to go visit japan and learn to use a katana from a master. I am single right now broke up with my ex-boyfriend about 3 months ago. I am looking forward to go camping with my family to<a= href”http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mbr/recarea/?recid=22498”> Bow River Campground</a> to get way from all the drama we are planning to stay for 2 weeks out there. My dad is going crazy about this tip he loves to plan everything out a two weeks a head over last min like we have planned. My older brother is not sure he will be joining us this trip he and his boyfriend have other plans. My sister not sure how she will live without here phone she on her phone all day the only time she not on it is when she sleeps otherwise she has it on her or texting someone. My mom been wanting to go on this trip for like 2 years now just been way too busy with work or someone has other plans like my brother she just hoping he will come along. </p>

<P> We hitting the road today with both of the dogs named Charlie and Amber. It’s going to be like 5 hours until we get there I plan on reading my books on katana or my veterinarian book for school I am not sure yet for right now I plan on looking at the sites around me. After staring out the window for a like 1 hour but feels like for every so I decided to read my veterinarian book from school. </p>

<p> Few hours later we arrived at your camp spot we let the dogs out my dad keep a eye on them as they both ran around the camp smelling everything I starting set up the tents while my dad and brother look around for any wild life suck as <u>Bears</u>,<u> Gray Wolves</u> and <u>Bobcats</u>. After setting up the three tents we decide that my mom and dad would share one tent, my sister and I would share one as well and my brother would get one for himself. The next morning my dad and I plan on going fishing for fun no one else wants to join us they have other plans on what they want to do on this trip. </p>

<p> Few hours later dad and I head out for the river close by we are going to be there all day we took one of the dogs with us for protection from some of the wildlife after a long walk we arrived at the river we found a spot to start fishing. My dad caught like 5 good size fish I on the other hand only got like 2 good size ones and one small fish that I let go it was getting later so we started to head back along the way we saw a Bobcat we watch from a far my dad had to hold the dog back after short few seconds the Bobcat went on it way I thought it was so cool to see one in the wild like that. When we got back to the camp we cleaned and skinned the fish so we could have them for dinner.</P>

<p> The next day I just stayed in camp reading my books and looking at wild life and taking a few pictures.</p>

<p>On the three day we decide to leave because it was just getting to cold outside for you to stay and more we planned for stay for only one week but we were just happy to come out camping for a few days I hope one day to come back out myself after I start my own family and go see japan. 
We all load back in to the car after a few min I fall a sleep. <h2>here is a few of the pictures I took on the trip.</h2></p><br/> <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/stalking-bobcat-19929788.jpg"alt="Bobcat" style="width:300px;height:350px;"> <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/bobcat-13622048.jpg" alt="Bobcat picture 2" style="width:300px;height:325px;">
