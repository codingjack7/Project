	<p class="red">Hello my name is Luigi right now I work at crazy town pizza it a new place that just opened up about one year ago. Right now I am planning on moving to San Francisco with my boyfriend who I been dating for three years now. his name is Elden my parents were not happy when I told them but my mom is fine with it but my I am pretty much dead to my dad I try very hard to make him happy and accept me for who I am but sadly nothing has changed. My mom is planning a camping trip I am not sure if I will go I am talk need to talk with my boyfriend first before I do anything. After a good long talk with my boyfriend and my mom I decide to go on the trip after I told my sisters my young’s sister was mad at me because now she stuck in the back with the dogs and they live to freaks out when every they see a dog or some things close to one also cats they love going after them.
</p><p class="orange">We finally got everything in the car we are about to head out when I forgot my phone in my room I asked if I could go get it but my dad was super mad already because we are running a little later. He told me NO you can live without your phone for a week. I just looked at him then said ok let’s go then I just end up sleeping all the way there when I woke up we reached the front entice to the camping ground after looking for a few min we found your spot. We all get out of the car and start unpacking I asked what the plans who sleeping with who. My dad looked at me and said you will get your own tent. Your sisters will share a tent mom and me (olen). After get everything set up my little sister woke up and started get mad a short while later I get in my tent start listening to music on the hand radio I took with me after a while I feel a sleep listing to the radio.
</p><p class="yellow">The next morning I woke up to my mom making some food for breakfast and it smelled great everyone else started waking up but my little sister. We all ate after that my sister and dad went fishing with one of the dogs. Two hours later my sister woke up and asked were the others went? My mom told her then asked would any one like to go on a walk I wanted to it sounded a lot of fun I asked are we going to take the other dog with us. My mom looked at me and said yes then she asked my sister and she said yes not very happy about it from the look on her face. We left for the walk after locking up everything making sure all the food in the car we should be back before the others come back.
</P><p class="ggreen">The next morning I just went on a walk by myself this time but I did take one of the dogs it was a short walk but fun I could see so many wildlife when I got back to camp I looked around and most people did not want to do anything until tomorrow I just went back in my tent and list to the radio for most of the day or I went on a walk.
</p><p class="blue">The next morning it stared snowing which was a surprise for everyone it should have not snowed for one to two weeks from now but we packed everything back into the car and head home I just looked out the window the hole time while me and my dad we the only ones to stay awake the hole way home we did not say much to each other but I love the trip I wish it did not snow
