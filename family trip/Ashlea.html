<p>	<div class="mom">Hello my name is Ashlea I am married to Olen who is a police officer he can be a little too strict for him own good. He wants everything done on a set of time when he say clean the dishes he wants them all done in 10 min after he told you to do it if not done in that time frame he will get mad if he gets so mad he will go lock himself in his office for a good 2 hours Whenever I look in the office he toss and breaks a lot of things in there lucky he does not break his computer or a window I mostly leave some stress ball in there hoping he would us it but sadly he rarely use it.
I been planning a camping trip for like two to three years now I want to bring the family before everyone goes their own ways luigi want to move to California San Francisco in the next year or two with his boyfriend I was so disponed when he told us he was gay last year he pretty much dead to my husband but I have come to terms with it.  Joy wants to move to Japan to learn sword fighting but lucky she not going anywhere until she finish collage.
 I finally got my husband to take a week off from week to go camping. He was not very happy with the idea at first he been wanting to go see his family in Canada like every year for the past twelve years now I got so sick and tired of going there so I been bugging him for the last two years to go camping. Now we are getting ready to go with the two dogs. After trying to get everything in the car all morning we feel a little behind Olen is getting very flustered that it taking so long we should have left one hour and twenty-seven minutes ago but that life.

<div class="walk">
<p>Finally got on the road all I did was look out the window and trying to keep very one clam everyone is reading a book or sleeping the kids hate the music Olen love to listen too for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AZLUohDCGo"> Jason Aldean - She's Country</a> I donâ€™t mind country music all that much I prefer classic music like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKPhGHAdqk0">Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata </a>
We finally get to your camp site my youngest daughter is sound asleep I told everyone just let her sleep we will set up the camp an hour later she finally wakes up and starts yelling at us saying why did you not wake me up? I told her I sad let you sleep she was so mad like her dad would be a chip off the old block after that I told her she would be sleeping with her sister but she want to sleep with me but Olen stepped in and told her who going were.
The next morning I got up and started making some food over an open fire and olen and joy went fishing with one of the dogs they will come back later that night. Linnea woke up and asked were everyone went I told her. I asked if she would like to go on a walk with me and luigi she just looked at me for a few min then sad not really but I do not want to be here alone so I will come along. We took the other dog with us we saw some deer nothing much I am glad we did not see and bears when we got back I started getting everything ready for dinner. After that was done I took a nap for a little bit until they come back from fishing.

<div class="snow"><p><strong>The next morning it started snowing my husband decided we will just pack everything up and go home we did not have the supplies for snow but it is odd it should not be snowing for two more weeks after getting everything in the car I was feeling a little sleepy but I just keep looking out the window hoping something would happen just seeing a moose in the wild but no luck about an hour in to the trip nothing happened but when we took a tight turn we see a wild grizzly bear  in the road to avoid hitting the bear we turn in a tree knocked out when I woke I looked around see no one moving I start calling every ones but sadly no one responds to me I start crying and shaking my husband for a response but nothing I slowly get out of the car look in my purse and get my phone but sadly it is dead. A few minutes later I drag myself to the road looking for help I heard a car coming but I was in the middle of the road the next thing I saw was nothing but<a href="wasitadream.html" style=color:green;> white?</a></p>
