<p>	Hello my name is Olen and I am happily married to Ashlea my wife we have three kids.my wife works at the high school as a math teacher. This year my wife been bugging me nonstop to go camping over see my family since her family passed away two years ago she was an only child she does not like to talk about them but I said fine we will go camping this time over seeing my family. With a big smile on her face she off to talk with the kids and see if they will come along. My two daughters will be coming along but my son is not sure I just wish he would stay here I really dislike his life choses he likes to think he dead to me but I still love him. I start loading the car with most stuff we will need for the camping trip I just hope it does not snow. They are taking so long to get everything in the car that I am just getting more and more mad that they are taking so long. 
I like to have everything so smoothly I want things done on time I hate things take so long to get done. We finally leave one hour latter. I turn on some music I love but my kids hate but they are not driving so too bad we spend about three hours in traffic when we finally get to your spot my youngest it sound asleep we let the two out I keep a close eye on them while making camp after we get done my youngest wakes up and starts getting mad. I get pretty mad when she started yelling at everyone I told her where she going to sleep likes it or not. 
The next morning jot and me decide to go fishing for dinner and we will take one of the dogs with us on the way out there we could see so many birds and deer running around it was ok I just wanted to go fishing sooner the better after a few hours we got a few fish started heading back to the camp. On the way back we see a wild Bobcat the dog wanted to go after it but I grabbed by the collar we waited a minute to see if it would go away on its own before we started going but luckily it left the dog calmed down when the Bobcat finally left we started to walk back to camp on the way back we just talked. We finally get back to camp with the fish joy and I start cleaning descaling them before we cook them.
The next morning I just looked for water to take a bath and relax for a few hours nothing much going on today everyone wants to do their own thing which is fine since I want to see my family like usual. I get back to camp later that night enjoys telling campfire storyâ€™s before bed. We are a woke around five twenty-seven in the morning because it was so cold I look outside I see so much snow  I wake everyone up and said we are heading home get everything in the car now before it gets too much worst.
